DESCRIPTION : Accident Analysis & Prevention provides wide coverage of the general areas relating to accidental injury and damage, including the pre-injury and immediate post-injury phases.

TOOLS USED : Power BI To analyze, I did data cleaning in Power Query, used Time intelligence Function/ Calendar Date Table in Power BI, Data Modelling(Relationship between multiple tables) , YTD and Y0Y Growth Calculations using DAX, KPI and Advanced Generations, Created Custom columns and measures in the reports, Import Images.

Learnings: The Whole Process involved the following Steps
1. Loading the Excel files to PowerBI
2. Data Cleaning and Data Transformations in Power Query.
3. Data Processing
4. Used Time Intelligence Function/Calendar Date Table in Power BI
5. Data Modelling (Relationship between Multiple tables)
6. Calculated YTD and YoY Growth using DAX
7. KPI and Advance KPI generations
8. Created calculated columns and measures in the report.
9. Imported Images
10. Created different charts and designed an Interactive report to analyse and visualize the data

AREAS TO BE ANALYSED :

1. Primary KPI- Total Casualties and Total Accident values for Current Year and YoY growth.
2. Primary KPI- Total Casualties by Accident Severity for Current Year and YoY growth.
3. Secondary KPI's - Total Casualties with respect to vehicle type for current Year.
4. Monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for Current Year and Previous Year.
5. Casualties by Road Type for Current year.
6. Current Year Casualties by Area/Location & by Day/ Night


Insights:
1. Total current year causalities (2022) is 195.7k which is a decrease of 11.9% from the previous year 2021.
2. Total current year accidents (2022) is 144.4k which is a decrease of 11.7% from the previous year 2021.
3. Total fatal causalities (2022) is 2.9k which is a decrease of 33.3% from the previous year 2021.
4. Total Serious causalities (2022) is 27.0k which is a decrease of 16.2% from the previous year 2021.
5. Total Slight causalities (2022) is 165.8k which is a decrease of 10.6% from the previous year 2021.
6. Cars, Vans,s and Bikes are the top 3 vehicles that are causing major causalities.
7. Casualties in the year 2022 gradually decreased as compared to the year 2021.
8. Single Carriageway, Dual Carriage, and roundabout are the road types which is causing major causalities.
9. 73.84% of causalities occurred in daylight and 26.16% of causalities occurred in the Dark.
10. 61.95% of causalities occurred in Urban areas and 38.05% of causalities occurred in Rural areas.
11. One can explore the map feature to analyze the causalities by location.
12. One can filter the data according to Weather Types and Road Surface Types.
